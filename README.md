# Outlook2016-to-OmniFocus
Script from Rainers that creates task from Outlook 2016 on the Mac to OmniFocus 3

All credit for the script goes to Rainer Burgstaller of http://rainer.4950.net.  

The script has primarily stayed the same, but there have been little tweaks here and there.  The last rainer script was version 12 in 2014 so my numbering will go from there.

This script version works with the following software:
Microsoft Outlook version 16.18 (181014)
OmniFocus 3.1.2 (v120.6 r320379) - it did not work before this version as the omnigroup corrected some bugs.  You must have the Pro version of omnifocus for the Applescript support.
